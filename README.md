# 5-Stage-Pipeline
a five stage pipeline constructed on Xilinxâ€™s Vivado in Verilog over an FPGA partially implementing the MIPS instruction set. In its current configuration, it supports only basic R-Format instructions like add, sub, and, or, etc. as well as basic I-Format instructions like lw and sw. Additionally, in this final revision of the pipeline, data forwarding to the instruction decode stage was implemented along with write-back of the register file on the negative edge of the clock both in order to reduce the penalty for data hazards. It achieves this functionality by making use of five pipeline registers, a control unit, an ALU, a number of multiplexors, dedicated memories for instructions and data, and a register file.
